# Vercel Deployment Guide

## Fixed Configuration âœ…

The deployment issue has been resolved with the following changes:

### 1. Created `vercel.json`
- Configured Next.js framework detection
- Set proper build command and function timeouts
- Added caching headers for API routes

### 2. Updated `next.config.ts`
- Added `output: 'standalone'` for proper Vercel deployment
- Configured image domains for external images
- Removed development-specific webpack config for production
- Added proper TypeScript and ESLint build settings

### 3. Build Verification
- âœ… Local build successful
- âœ… `.next` directory generated correctly
- âœ… All routes and API functions compiled

## Deployment Steps

### Option 1: Vercel CLI (Recommended)
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Deploy to Vercel
vercel --prod
```

### Option 2: Vercel Dashboard
1. Push your code to GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket
2. Import project in Vercel dashboard
3. Vercel will automatically detect Next.js and use the configuration

### Option 3: Manual Configuration
If you still get the output directory error:
1. Go to your Vercel project settings
2. Under "Build & Development Settings"
3. Set "Output Directory" to `.next`
4. Set "Build Command" to `npm run build`
5. Set "Install Command" to `npm install`

## Environment Variables
Add these in Vercel dashboard under Settings > Environment Variables:
```
NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1
NODE_ENV=production
```

## Post-Deployment Checklist
- [ ] Landing page loads correctly
- [ ] AI chatbot responds to messages
- [ ] All floating animations work
- [ ] Comparison matrix tooltips function
- [ ] API endpoints respond (check browser dev tools)

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues:
1. Check Vercel deployment logs
2. Verify all files are committed to git
3. Ensure `package.json` has correct build script
4. Check that `vercel.json` is in the root directory

The configuration is now optimized for Vercel's Next.js deployment! ðŸš€
